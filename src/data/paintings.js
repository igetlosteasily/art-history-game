// The 32 works students study: Chase's collection, one entry per painting.
//
// Used by: every screen. Rounds are dealt from this list, the wall label shows
// its facts, and grading checks typed answers against it.
// Why it exists as its own file: this is the file Chase edits most. Keeping the
// collection apart from the game's rules means adding or correcting a painting
// never touches game code. The tests in paintings.test.js check every entry.
//
// To add a painting:
// 1. Put the original image in public/images/.
// 2. Copy an entry below and edit it. `id` must be unique: lowercase words
//    joined by hyphens. `movement` must be an id from movements.js.
// 3. Run `npm run images` to make the fast web versions, then `npm run test`.
//
// The fields:
// - title: the title as a museum label shows it.
// - titleAccepted: other names students may fairly use (a French title, the
//   title without a subtitle). The title itself always counts, so list only
//   alternatives. Written normalized: lowercase, no accents, no punctuation,
//   no leading "the" or "a".
// - artist.last is what the exam asks for. The full and last names always
//   count; artistAccepted lists only other spellings.
// - year and medium are display text for the label.
// - alsoAccept (optional): extra movement ids that also count as correct, for
//   works that sit between two movements.
// - image.original: the file name in public/images/. image.alt describes the
//   picture for screen readers without naming the movement.
// - explanation: Chase's text.
//
// Facts marked VERIFY were drafted during the rebuild, not taken from Chase's
// original file. They are listed in docs/LEARNING.md for Chase to check.

Morisot's use of light, color, and loose brushwork exemplifies the Impressionist focus on capturing the fleeting effects of nature and modern life. Morisot was the daughter of a wealthy bourgeois civil servant. According to Katz and Dars' book, 'The Impressionists,' when her family hired a private tutor to teach her and her sister to paint, the tutor warned, 'Considering the character of your daughters, my teaching will not endow them with minor drawing room accomplishments: they will become painters. Do you realize what this means? In the haute bourgeois milieu to which you belong, this will be revolutionary, I might almost add catastrophic. Are you sure that you will not curse the day when art, having gained admission to your home, now so respectable and peaceful, will become the sole arbiter of the fate of your two children?'",
